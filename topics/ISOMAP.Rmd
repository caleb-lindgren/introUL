## Isometric Feature Map (ISOMAP)

### Introduction

The first manifold learning method we are going to cover is the Isometric Feature Map (ISOMAP), originally published by Tenenbaum, de Silva, and Langford in 2000 [@isomap]. As suggested by the name, we will see that the assumption of isometry is central to this method. ISOMAP combines the major algorithmic features of PCA and MDS --- computational efficiency, global optimality, and asymptotic convergence guarantees. Thanks to these extraordinary features, ISOMAP is capable of learning a broad class of nonlinear manifolds.
